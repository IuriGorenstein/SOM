# Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
Codes used in Atlantic decadal variability and control over NE and WAF precipitation (with SOMpy)

This codes are an adaptation from the SOMpy library to produce the results in the " " article (currently in review)

The example in Drive.py uses public data from the Cmip6 climate models to create the Self Organizing Maps feature space and its clusterization.
The main effort from this code is to compute the percentages matrix, which semmed necessary for the Best Matching Unit in the SOMpy library didn't seem to project the data in to the feature space and back to the input space.

If you are a fellow scientist or researcher feel free to use and adapt this code. If you do, please cite us in your article.
